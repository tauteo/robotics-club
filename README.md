## Introduction
This repository contains all of the lesson plans for the Raspberry Pi training sessions

In order to follow along, you will need the following as a minimum:
* A Raspberry Pi (I recommend either the 3B or the 3B+)
* A 5V/2.5A micro-USB power supply
* An >=8GB  micro-SD card (I recommend a class 10 SD card as the speed difference will be notable with slower cards)

If you will mainly interface with your Pi via a computer on the same network (wired or wireless), then this is all you need.

If you would like to connect directly to your Pi (this is easier for beginners), then you will also need the following:<sup>1</sup>
* A USB keyboard (wired or wireless)<sup>2</sup>
* A USB mouse (wired or wireless)<sup>2</sup>
* A screen with an HDMI input (RCA works, but with limited resolution. You can also use a HDMI-VGA converter)

Completely optional extras:
* A case

> <sup>1</sup>Please check the [verified peripherals][verified-peripherals] before buying any keyboards, mice, or VGA adapters. Some peripherals are not compatible with Raspberry Pi.

> <sup>2</sup>Some bluetooth keyboards and mice do work, but check the [verified peripherals][verified-peripherals] list to confirm that it is compatible with the Pi.
