# An overview of Linux

## Introduction
This is not a comprehensive overview of everything in linux. It is a somewhat abbreviated introduction to the core components of linux that you need to be able to use the operating system meaningfully. As such, it covers topics in only enough detail to allow you to understand how it works and why it is there.

The best way to learn remains actual use, and therefore the more you use linux, the more you will become confident in using it. If you only use it occasionally, then you will learn slowly.

You should not have to read everything in here in sequence or in one sitting. Feel free to jump around to the sections you are interested in and use the others as a reference.

## Kernel structure
![kernel architecture][kernel-arch]

Linux is known as a modular operating system. This means that different sections of the operating system are independent of each other and can theoretically be swapped out with a different component which does the same thing. For example, if you would like to use a different file system type, then you can include the new type and rebuild the kernel.

The components that support this type of modularity are the file system types, block devices (i.e. how bits are written to storage), character devices (i.e. how characters are read and displayed), and interface drivers (i.e. how the OS connects to other systems via a network).

All of these modules form the base of the operating system, but none of these systems are directly accessible from the user space. In order to allow access from higher levels, the base levels are abstracted into kernel subsystems (such as the virtual file system, virtual memory system and process management system). These subsystems have direct access to the base systems.

Direct access to the kernel subsystems is also not possible from the user space. Instead, there is another layer of abstraction between the user and the kernel subsystems called the "system call interface". The user can access subsystem functions by using this standardised abstraction.

## File system
### Structure
![linux file system structure][filesys-structure]

The linux file system is built on top of the virtual file system kernel subsystem. As such, it does not start with direct access to physical devices (like C:) like in Windows. Like most file systems, the linux file system is a tree structure.

Like any tree, the structure starts at the root. This level is indicated simply by "/" (note the forward slash instead of the backslash that is used in Windows). The root directory (also called a folder in Windows) contains all of the base directories that make up the file system. Each base directory is responsible for keeping files related to a specific task (such as configuration, temporary files, programs etc.).

The base directories and their functions are listed below:
1. **/bin**  
   Contains essential binaries (compiled programs) that are necessary for the system to work. This includes programs that for example list file contents, change file ownership, mount new file systems and so on
2. **/sbin**  
    This directory is similar to the `/bin` directory in the sense that it contains compiled programs (i.e. binaries). The difference is that all programs intended to be run by the "root" user for system administration are placed here.
2. **/boot**  
   This contains static files needed to boot up the system, such as the `initd` file which specifies in which order programs need to be started after booting and what resources need to be available before these programs can be started.
3. **/etc**  
   Contains all of the configuration files, including the boot configuration files, needed to run the system. The configurations specified here apply to all users. They are generally text files and can be edited if you should want to change some configuration.
4. **/dev**  
   Linux exposes devices as files, and this directory contains a number of special files that represent devices. These are not actual files as we know them, but they appear as files. A good example of this is the `/dev/sda` file which represents a physical storage drive connected to the system.
   This directory also contains pseudo devices like `/dev/random` (which produces a random number when read) and `/dev/null` which produces no output and discards all input.
5. **/home**  
   This directory contains a subdirectory for each user that is registered on the system. The `pi` user on the Raspberry Pi therefore has a subdirectory called `/home/pi`, which is located here.
   You will typically place all of the files that you work on here as files created here are only accessible by yourself.

   It is also important to note that a user generally does not have write access to files located elsewhere.
6. **/lib**  
   All of the libraries needed by the programs on the system (i.e. in `/bin` and `/sbin`) are stored here.
7. **/media**  
   Contains a subdirectory for every removable media device (i.e. flash drives, or CDs) that is connected to the system. These subdirectories are created automatically when the media is inserted.
8. **/mnt**  
   All temporary mount points go here. This is typically used when mounting a temporary file system such as a folder or drive shared via the network (typically from another OS like Windows).

   It must be noted that this is a convention only and that a mount point can be created anywhere on the system.
9. **/opt**  
    This contains subdirectories for optional software that is installed by the user and which doesn't follow the standard file system hierarchy.
10. **/root**  
    This is the home directory for a special user called "root" (different to the file system root `/`). The "root" user has special access to all system files (but not to necessarily to user files).
11. **/usr**  
    All applications and files used by users (as opposed to being used by the system) are placed here. In other words, programs located here are deemed to be non-essential.

    Programs are again separated into general programs (located in `/usr/bin`) and system administration programs (located in `/usr/sbin`). Libraries for programs in both these locations are located in `/usr/lib`. Programs that are compiled locally are installed to `/usr/local` to prevent them from interfering with system programs.
12. **/var**  
    This directory contains all variable data files. This is typically where log files are written to (under `/var/log`).
13. **/tmp**  
    All temporary files are stored here and are typically deleted when the system is restarted or by cleanup programs such as `tmpwatch`.
14. **/proc**  
    Contains information on running processes.

### Paths
File paths are a set of directions that specify where to find the file that you want. As with any set of directions, you can provide them from either a fixed point of reference (e.g. if you start at the mall and drive towards the highway) or from your current position (e.g. from here, take a left to the mall and then continue to the highway).

In linux, the fixed point of reference is always the root `/` of the filesystem. An example of a path specified in this way is `/home/pi/programs/blink.py`. As you can see it starts with the `/`, then adds on a step `/home`. This process is repeated (i.e. `/home/pi`, then `/home/pi/programs`, and finally `/home/pi/programs/blink.py`) until the destination file `blink.py` is reached. This form of specifying a path (providing directions to a file) is called "absolute addressing", as it starts from an absolute point of reference.

The second method of providing directions to a file is called relative addressing (as it is in relation to your current position in the filesystem). In order to use this method effectively, you need two short cuts.

The first short cut is called `.`, it specifies the current directory. An example of this would be if you are already in the `/home/pi` directory and want to navigate to the `blink.py` file in the previous example. Using relative addressing, this can be written as `./programs/blink.py` (you can also use an even shorter route and just write `programs/blink.py`)

The second shortcut is called `..` and it means the parent directory or the directory that contains the current directory. Let's assume that we are in the directory `/home/pi/notes` and that we want to move from there to the `/home/pi/programs` directory. We can write that, in the relative form, as `../programs/blink.py`. Which simply means "go one directory up from where I am currently" (i.e. move from `/home/pi/notes` to `/home/pi`) and then go into the subdirectory called `programs`.

If you get lost on the path, then simply return to the root `/` or return to your home directory, which can be accessed with the short cut `~`.

### File types
As mentioned previously, everything in linux is represented with a file. A file simply means anything that stores information, whether that be information on other files and directories (which is what a directory is), bytes and information (a "regular" file) or access to a stream of data (like a network connection).

Most files actually contain information that is stored as bytes that have no special meaning to humans, but which have a very specific meaning to the computer. These files are called binary files (e.g. compiled programs, a music file and so on). Some files do contain information that is meaningful to humans, usually in the form of text (e.g. config files, reports etc.).

You can see that files in linux are slightly different to how you used to think of a file in Windows. Another difference is that files in linux do not require an extension (e.g. the `.py` part in `blink.py`). Extensions are only used as conventions and maintain some sanity, but do not restrict the use of the file at all. Some conventions are to label Python files with the `.py` extension, C files with the `.c` extension, configuration files with the `.conf` extension and so on.

## Terminal commands
Up to now, the discussion has been rather abstract and you have not really seen anything which you can use to control a linux system. That changes shortly.

We will begin by learning commands that allow us to move around the file system. We will then move on to working with files (i.e. create, read, edit, delete). Later on we will discuss how to create and manage users and access to files, as well as how to get help if you are stuck with a command. Finally, we will learn how to identify and manage processes.

But first, a short introduction to the shell is needed.
### The shell
The shell is the outermost layer of any linux system. It is a program that can read commands typed in plain (well, somewhat plain) language and translate it into commands that the system understands.

All shell commands are typed into the terminal, which is itself a program that allows interaction with the shell using a keyboard and a screen.

The input to a terminal is usually identified by your username, the directory you are currently in and the prompt (which is normally the symbol `$`, but can be any of the symbols `>`, `%`, `#`). A prompt in a terminal usually looks like the following:
![raspberry pi terminal][raspi-terminal]

The commands that you type into the terminal are usually the names of programs to run. The shell then runs the program and then displays the output of the program on the terminal. After the output is displayed, the terminal then displays the prompt again.

In addition to running commands that you type into the terminal, the shell does some other things as well. Some of the most useful are:
1. **Keeping history**  
   The shell keeps a history of all of the commands that you enter into the terminal. You can view the history by typing `history` into the terminal (i.e. running the `history` command). You can also view previous commands by cycling through them with the up and down arrow keys.
2. **Command completion**  
   It is not always necessary to type a command in full as the shell knows which commands are available. It will automatically fill in the command if you start typing the first few characters of the command and then press the `Tab` key. If the letters that you typed so far are too generic (in other words, more than one command starts with that combination), the shell will not know which specific command you want to enter. In this case, you can then press the `Tab` key twice, which will give you a list of available commands starting with the combination you entered (this is useful if you forgot the full command but remember how it started). Command completion also works for file and directory names.
3. **Environment variables**
   The shell keeps a list of variables in the background that are used to set up the execution environment for the terminal session. These variables are identified by the `$` sign and an all caps name, e.g. `$SHELL` (which contains the path to the shell executable, this should be `/bin/bash` on the pi). Another important variable is `$PATH`, which contains a list of directories where the shell will look for binaries (compiled programs that can be run from the shell).

### Moving around
The first command we will type is the `whoami` command. This asks the shell to run the program of the same name and return the username of the current user.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~ $ whoami
pi
pi@raspberry:~ $
```

The next command is very useful if you ever get lost on the filesystem. It is called `pwd`, which is an abbreviation of "print working directory". As you can imagine, it will print the absolute address of the directory that you are in currently.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~ $ pwd
/home/pi
pi@raspberry:~ $
```

If you know where you are, then you may want to see what is around you (i.e. which files and directories are contained in your current directory). You can do this with the `ls` command, which is short for "list" but which you can also think of as a Light Switch that turns on the lights and illuminates your surroundings.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls
blink.py
pi@raspberry:~ $
```

Once you know what is around you, you can move around into other directories by using the `cd` (change directory) command
```bash
#using relative address
pi@raspberry:~ $ cd programs
pi@raspberry:~/programs $

#moving back up
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ cd ..
pi@raspberry:~ $

#using absolute addressing
pi@raspberry:~ $ cd /home/pi/programs
pi@raspberry:~/programs $
```

### Working with files
As soon as you are comfortable moving around the filesystem, you can try to make new files and directories. For files, this is achieved by using the `touch` command. For directories, the command is `mkdir` (short for "make directory").

```bash
#creating a file
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ touch blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls
blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 

#creating a directory
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ mkdir notes
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls
blink.py notes
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

We can now edit the file we just created with the `nano` command. This asks the shell to run the "nano" program, which is a very basic text editor. The `nano` command is different to the other commands in the sense that it is an interactive command, meaning that the program waits for additional input from you before it completes.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ nano blink.py
```
Running this command opens the nano editor, which looks like this:
![nano][nano-editor]
You can save the file using `Ctrl + O` and `Enter`. Then exit with `Ctrl + X`, which will bring you back to the terminal.

This is obviously not a very nice way of editing a file as it does not provide any syntax highlighting or command completion. We will look into better ways of editing files later on.

We can display the contents of the file directly on the terminal by using the `cat` command. This prints out the entire contents of the file in one go, which is not very nice if there is a lot of stuff in the file (there will be a lot of scrolling).
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ cat blink.py
print("hello world")
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

Two alternative commands to print out file contents are `less` and `more`, both of which support *paging*. This displays the contents of the file one page (screen height) at a time. The `less` command is the preferred command, as it has more functionality (less is more...). You can use the arrow keys to move up and down, as well as the space bar to scroll a whole page. Press `q` to exit and return to the terminal.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ less blink.py
```
![less command][less-viewer]

Simply creating a file may not be enough. Rather than duplicating file contents, it is most often easier to simply copy the contents of a file to a new file. This is achieved using the `cp` command. 

The `cp` command introduces a second "argument" to a command. Up to now we have been writing the command name, followed by the argument or target of the command. Copy has the format `cp [source] [destination]`.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ cp blink.py also-blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls
blink.py also-blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

If you would rather move the file to a new destination, then use the `mv` command. The `mv` command is also used to rename files.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ mkdir backups
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ mv also-blink.py backups
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls
blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls backups
also-blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

It is important to note that the arguments to these commands can be any file path. In other words, either the first or the second argument (or both) can be a path name written as an absolute or relative path.

Making a lot of files can obviously result in some clutter which makes it difficult to find what you are looking for. You can delete unwanted files using the `rm` command, but be careful as there is no recycle bin in linux and files deleted using `rm` are gone forever.
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ rm blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls
backups
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```
Using `rm` on a directory will not work. It will simply print an error:
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ rm backups
rm: cannot remove 'backups/': Is a directory
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```
To delete a directory, we must use the `rmdir` command (but this will only work on empty directories):
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ rmdir backups
rmdir: failed to remove 'backups': Directory not empty
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

In order to be able to delete a non-empty directory (this means deleting the directory and **EVERYTHING** in it forever), we need to introduce the concept of command options. Options are additional parameters supplied to the command that change the behaviour of the command. There is thus always the default behaviour of the command (without any options) and then optional behaviour that can be switched on or off depending on the options given when you ask the shell to run the command.

An option is always identified by the dash `-` character, followed by one or more characters denoting the required option. In this manner, we can specify the `r` (recursive) and `f` (force) options when running the `rm` command (which will give us `rm -rf`). This basically means that we are asking the shell to run the `rm` command for each and every file and subdirectory in the directory we are trying to delete (thus deleting everything in turn) and to force the deletion even if we get errors and warnings. Here is an example:
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ rm -rf backups
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

### Partitions
Partitions are separations in the files system that prevent problems in one section from affecting normal operation in another section. You can use the `df` (disk filesystems) command to see information about the different partitions on your machine. This information will include the partition name,  the number of blocks, the number of used blocks, the number of available blocks, the percentage space used, and the mount point for the partition. 

As humans, we are not that interested in the block availability, but rather the size (in bytes) availability. We therefore usually use the `-h` (human readable) option with the `df` command (thus giving `df -h`). This should result in something similar to the image below:
![calling df][df-result]

Even if one partition is completely full (which will not allow you to write any new data to that partition), the other partitions will still have space and will continue to operate normally. In addition to this benefit, partitions are also used to manage security (e.g. do not allow any programs on a certain partition to execute), to separate mount points to different hard drives, and to manage the amount of space that is available to a certain user.

### Combining instructions
There are a couple of ways to combine commands in linux, but we must first learn about a very useful command called `grep` (which stands for "global regular expression print"). The `grep` command basically scans through text input and only returns things that match a supplied pattern. This will help us to make sense of the results we get when combining commands.

Let us say that we want to keep track of all of the commands that we have learnt so far. We can create a file called `commands` and write the names of all of the commands in the file. Something like this:
```bash
#create the file and open the editor at the same time
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ nano commands
#enter the known commands using the nano editor
#.
#.
#.
#print out the contents
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ cat commands
whoami
pwd
touch
ls
cd
mkdir
rm
rmdir
groups
man
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

If we only want to see the commands that have the letter 'd' somewhere in them, we can use the `grep` command thus:
```bash
#only return the commands that have the letter 'd' in them
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ grep d commands
pwd
cd
mkdir
rmdir
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

The first way of combining two commands is by using the pipe `|` character. The pipe connects the output of one command to the input of the following command, like so:
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls /bin | grep d
```
The first command will list the names of all of the files in `/bin`. This list is then piped (connected) to the `grep` command, which reads through it and filters out the entries which don't have the letter 'd' in them.

The `grep` command (and most other commands) can also be used with the wildcard characters if you are unsure about the input. The `?` wildcard means "any one character", whereas the `*` wildcard means "any number of characters". We can use them as follows:
```bash
#list all commands in /bin that start with 'l' and are only two characters long
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls /bin/l?
/bin/ln   /bin/ls
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
#list all commands in /bin that start with 'l' and are any length
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls /bin/l*
/bin/launchctl    /bin/link   /bin/ln   /bin/ls
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

The second way of combining commands is with the redirection `>` character. The redirection changes where the output of a command goes, so instead of printing the results to a terminal we can instead redirect it to a file (or some other destination). This works as follows:
```bash
#take the output of the grep command and redirect it to a file called d-commands.txt
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ grep d commands > d-commands.txt
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ cat d-commands.txt
pwd
cd
mkdir
rmdir
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ 
```

The third way of combining commands is to use logical combinators, i.e. `&&` (AND operation) and `||` (OR operation). These can be used as follows:
```bash
#make a new directory and if it is successful, change directory into the new directory
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ mkdir notes && cd notes
#try to delete a directory and if it fails, try to force delete the directory
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ rmdir notes || rm -rf notes
```
## Users and access restrictions
Access control in linux is separated into three areas called "User", "Group" and "Other" (which just means everyone else). Your username uniquely identifies you as a "User" and any files that you create are "owned" by your username. In addition to this, all users belong to one or more groups, the purpose of which is to group users that share similar functionality together. You can so to which groups you belong by running the `groups` command.

Each file (whether this is a directory, a plain file, a binary file, a device file, or any other type of file) has certain permissions assigned to it. These permissions are called `R` (read), `W` (write), and `X` (execute). They are independently assigned to users, groups, and other, which means that a file has `rwx` permissions for a certain user, `rwx` permissions for a certain group and `rwx` permissions for other.

In order to see which permissions have been assigned to a file, we need to run the `ls` command with the `-l` option (giving `ls -l`). This will give us output like the following:
![lsl command][lsl-result]

These results can be interpreted in the following way:  
[**column 1**]    The assigned permissions of the file  
[**column 2**]    The number of links to the file  
[**column 3**]    The owner of the file  
[**column 4**]    The group that the file belongs to  
[**column 5**]    The size of the file in bytes  
[**columns 6-8**] The creation date of the file  
[**column 9**]    The name of the file

The file permissions can be broken up into a further four columns, e.g. `- rwx rwx rwx`, with a `-` in any of the `r`, `w`, or `x` positions signifying that either the user, the group or other does not have that specific permission. The columns are interpreted as follows:
![file permission groups][ugo-layout]

The first character is used to show the file type. It is usually a `-` for normal files, but can also be a `d` for directories, an `l` for a link, and many others also.

You can add and remove permissions from a file by using the `chmod` (change mode) command with the relevant options. Let us assume that the file permissions for the blink.py file are `-rw-r--r--`, which means that the user has read and write permissions, the group has read permissions, and other also has read permissions.
```bash
#give write permission to the group
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ chmod g+w blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls -l
-rw-rw-r--    1   pi  pi  somedate  blink.py
#take away write permission from the group
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ chmod g-w blink.py
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ ls -l
-rw-r--r--    1   pi  pi  somedate  blink.py
```

Assigning rights to user (u), group (g), or other (o) is thus a simple case of calling `chmod` with the option `u`, `g`, `o`, or any combination such as `ugo` or `ug`, followed by a `+` to assign or a `-` to remove a permission, and finally the permission itself `r`, `w`, `x`, or any combination such as `rw`.

**The root user**  
In addition to the registered users (and some other background and maintenance users), there is a special user known as `root`. This user can access any and all files in the system and can run any of the commands available (even the system admin commands in `/sbin`). As mentioned previously, the home directory for this user is `/root`.

In order to execute any commands as the root user, you need to be logged in as the root user. You can do this by logging out and then logging in with the root login, but this quickly becomes tedious. An easier way is to use the `su` (switch user, super user, substitute user) command. This will ask you for the root password and will then switch to the root user. Any commands that you execute after this will be run as the user `root`. You can also switch to any other user by supplying the username after `su`, like so: `su - otheruser`.

In some cases, you may only want to execute one command as `root`. When this is the case, it would be tedious to run `su`, login as `root`, execute the command and then switch back to your own user account. To make this easier, the `sudo` command was introduced. The `sudo` command will only execute one command as root without switching user accounts (it will still prompt for a password of course).

## Getting help
So far we have a basic understanding of how to move around the file system and interact with files. There is a lot more to learn, but covering all of the commands in one place is going to be difficult. You can always have a look at which commands are available by running `ls /bin` (also try `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/local/bin`, and `/usr/local/sbin`). If you want to know what an unfamiliar command does or even what options are available on known commands, you can always use the `man` (manual) command.

The `man` command will print documentation for the command to the terminal and will usually cover basic usage of the command, describe what the command does, and describe each option and how to use it. In addition, the man page will also tell you which commands are related to this one.

## Process management
Whenever you execute a command, you start a process. A process is an action that is allocated system resources (such as CPU time, RAM, IO, etc.) by the operating system in order to complete a certain task. Some processes execute and return a result almost immediately (e.g. `ls`), whereas other processes stay running until you ask them to stop (e.g. `nano`).

You can see which processes are currently running by issuing the `ps` (process) command. This will return a list of processes and information about these processes. 

The most important piece of information returned is the PID or Process ID. This is a number that uniquely represents that specific process and can be used to interact with and control the process itself (which is different to interacting with the command that is running in the process).

In addition to the processes that you start by executing commands in the shell, there are also many system processes that are stopped and started automatically by the operating system and run in the background.

The `ps` command alone will only list active processes. In order to see all processes (including those that have been stopped temporarily), we need to use the `-a` option. In order to see the system processes, we need to use the `-x` option. Finally, in order to see the names of the system processes, we need to use the `-u` option. By combining all of the options, we arrive at the most commonly used form of the `ps` command, which is `ps -aux`. The output of this command can be fairly long, too long to include here.

Although the `ps` command is useful, it only returns a static list of processes. If we want to see additional information like CPU and RAM usage, we need to use the `top` command. This returns a dynamically updated list of processes (which changes as processes are stopped and started, and even when CPU or RAM usage changes). This is rather like using the Task Manager in Windows.

**Stopping processes**  
It may happen at some point that a process hangs or crashes, in which case we may want to forcibly stop the process. In this case we can use the `kill` command, which takes a PID as an argument, e.g. `kill 123`. We can also force a process to exit by using the `-9` option, which would then give us the command `kill -9 123`.

In order to illustrate this, we need to know how to run a process in the background. This is easily achieved by appending the `&` character to a command, like so `top &`. Running a process like this will return a job number (e.g. `[1]`) and a PID. If we run another process in the background, like `nano &`, it will return an incremented job number (i.e. `[2]` in this case) as well as another PID. You can view the jobs you have running in the background by simply using the `jobs` command.

You can return the process to the *foreground* by using the `fg` command.

## Package management
Just like the operating system is modular, so the software programs that you install are also modular. This means that a specific program may use several other programs in order to do its job. These other programs are called the dependencies of the program (because the program *depends* on them to run). Keep in mind that the dependencies may also themselves depend on other programs to do their job.

You can imagine then that installing any program may result in a nightmarish cycle of travelling down the "dependency chain" and installing each dependency in turn before moving up again to install the higher level program. This is something that most people will quickly give up on. Luckily, this is not necessary, as the problem has been automated so that all of this is done for you by a program called a package manager.

Each program must include a list of its dependencies in its installation package. The package manager will then read this list of dependencies and attempt to automatically install each dependency (and sub-dependencies also) in turn until it can install the program you requested. But where will it find the install packages for these dependencies, you may ask? 

Well, every distribution of linux maintains a repository (actually several repositories) of software install packages that is searched by the package manager when it finds that it needs a dependency of which it does not have a local copy. This can actually be a bit slow (especially if the repository server is on the other side of the world), so to improve performance, the package manager will first download an "index" of packages available at a certain repository. It will then search this local index for the dependency package and will then download the package from the repository and install it. This is done for every package in the dependency chain until the original program is also downloaded and installed.

The package manager for Raspbian is called `apt` (since Raspbian is based on Debian, which also uses the `apt` package manager). To use the package manager, you execute the `apt-get` command followed by some options. Take note that modifying existing packages or installing new packages will make changes to the entire system, and as such the commands need to be run as the `root` user (which is achieved by using `sudo`).

To update the package index from the repositories, use the following:
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ sudo apt-get update
```
To install a new package, you can use the `install` option like so:
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ sudo apt-get install [package name]
```
You can also install multiple packages in one go by again using the `install` option, but then supplying it with a list of packages:
```bash
pi@raspberry:~/programs $ sudo apt-get install [package1] [package2] [package3]
```
