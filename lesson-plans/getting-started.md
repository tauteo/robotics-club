# Getting started with Raspberry Pi

## OS installation
Before you can use your Raspberry Pi, you must load an operating system (OS) onto the SD card.

### OS options
There are several options of operating systems available to run on the Raspberry Pi. The basic options are:
1. Raspbian (official OS)
2. Ubuntu MATE
3. Windows 10 IoT Core (not a full version of windows)
4. OSMC (Open Source Media Centre)
5. LibreELEC (just enough Linux for Kodi...)
...and many more

We will be using Raspbian, which is based on the Debian distrubution of Linux. The current version of Raspbian is named "Strectch".
