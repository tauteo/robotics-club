# How to connect to your Raspberry Pi remotely

## Introduction

Up to now, we have been using the Pi while it is connected to a dedicated screen, keyboard, and mouse. In many cases, this is either not practical or it is simply unnecessary, as the most common use case for a Pi is as an application server. As such, the Pi will mostly be running either dedicated IO programs or it will be running higher level management programs that talk to other remote IO platforms (such as the Arduino).
Neihter of these use cases requires a graphical interface that runs directly on the Pi. It would even be preferable to run a graphical interface as a web site, in which case a direct connection is most definitely not needed.

Running the Pi without a dedicated screen, keyboard, and mouse is called running it in "headless" mode. But, if we are not able to interact directly with the Pi, how would we go about creating and running programs on the Pi? This is exactly the question that is answered in this lesson.
